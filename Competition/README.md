To create a model please use **IPA.csv** dataset (used it for both train and validation dataset) and predict labels on **IPA_test.csv** data. Description of dataset features can be found in **IPA_description.txt**.

In the e-mail please specify name of the group and members. Required attachments are:
1. R/Python/Julia script or notebook with used code
2. CSV file named **[group_name]_IPA_prediction.csv** with one column named **Prediction** containing 5000 predictions with values 1/0 or TRUE/FALSE for dataset **IPA_test.csv**. Please make sure predictions order is the same as rows in test data.
